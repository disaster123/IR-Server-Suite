This is the Serial Command configuration window.<BR>
<P><B>Command</B><BR>Enter the command text here, using escape codes for special characters as follows:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>\a = Alert (ascii 7)</LI>
<LI>\b = Backspace (ascii 8)</LI>
<LI>\f = Form Feed (ascii 12)</LI>
<LI>\n = Line Feed (ascii 10)</LI>
<LI>\r = Carriage Return (ascii 13)</LI>
<LI>\t = Tab (ascii 9)</LI>
<LI>\v = Vertical Tab (ascii 11)</LI>
<LI>\x = Hex Value (\x0Fh = ascii char 15, \x8h = ascii char 8)</LI>
<LI>\0 = Null (ascii 0)</LI>
</UL>
You can use normal text inside the command, and if it is for an external channel change there are additional parameters that can be discovered by clicking the "?" button.  The above escape codes let you put in special characters that can't be typed.  For example, if your STB (or whatever you're connecting) needs the ascii code for escape you would use \x1Bh where 1B (27 decimal) is hex for the ascii code for the escape button.</P>
