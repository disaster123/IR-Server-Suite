<H2>IR Blast (Command line tool)<BR><HR COLOR="RED"></H2>
<P>IR Blast is for blasting IR commands from the command line.</P>

<P>But really IR Blast is to interface with other software that can launch external applications for IR Blasting.</P>

<P>Usage:<BR>
<BR>
IRBlast -host {server} [-port x] [-pad x] [-channel] {commands}<BR>
<BR>
Use -host to specify the computer that is hosting the IR Server.<BR>
Use -port to blast to a particular blaster port (optional).<BR>
Use -channel to tell IR Blast to break apart the following IR Command and use each digit for a separate IR blast (optional).<BR>
Use -delay to specify a time to delay between each command or digit in a channel number (Optional).<BR>
Use -pad to tell IR Blast to pad channel numbers to a certain length (Optional, Requires -channel).<BR>
Use a tilde ~ between commands to insert half second pauses.</P>

<P>Examples:<BR>
<BR>
IRBlast -host HTPC TV_Power.IR<BR>
<BR>
This would blast the TV_Power.IR command on the HTPC computer to the default blaster port.<BR>
<BR>
IRBlast -host MEDIAPC -port Port_2 "Turn on surround.IR"<BR>
<BR>
This would blast the "Turn on surround.IR" command on the MEDIAPC computer to blaster port 2.<BR>
<BR>
IRBlast -host HTPC -pad 4 -channel 302<BR>
<BR>
This would blast the 3.IR, 0.IR, and 2.IR commands on the HTPC computer to the default blaster port.</P>

<BR>
<P>There is also a windowless version of IR Blast in the same folder as "IRBlast.exe" called "IRBlast-NoWindow.exe"</P>
<P>IR Blast (No Window) uses the exact same command line parameters as IRBlast, but when called from another application it will not create a command prompt window.</P>
