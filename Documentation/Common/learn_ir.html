<LI>Click "Learn" to teach the plugin your IR command. After clicking "Learn" you point your remote at the IR device and press the button to learn. Follow all the usual procedures for teaching IR commands.  That is, avoid direct sunlight on the receiver, stay away from plasma tv's, and turn off any fluerescent lights.  All these things can interfere with the InfraRed signals.  Place your remote within a couple of centimeters (within an inch) of the receiver to ensure good reception of the signal.</LI>
