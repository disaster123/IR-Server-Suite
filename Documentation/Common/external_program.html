This window is for setting up the "Run" command to launch applications.<BR>
<P><B>Program:</B><BR>Type in the file path to the application you want to run, or select the executable by clicking the "..." button.</P>
<P><B>Start in folder:</B><BR>This is the folder the program will be launched from, this will affect software that then tries to access other files through the use of relative paths.  By default, when you select the program executable the plugin will automatically fill in the start folder and you should only need to change this in special circumstances.  You will know when.</P>
<P><B>Parameters:</B><BR>Type in any command line parameters you wish to pass to the application. You will need to put in special command line parameters if you are using this program for channel changing on a set top box. If you have set up the program from the External Channel Changing dialog you will see a "?" button to the right of the parameters field. Clicking this button will show a list of special parameters for external channel changing if applicable, they are:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>%1 = Current channel number digit (-1 for Select/Pre-Change)</LI>
<LI>%2 = Full channel number string</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><B>Window Style:</B><BR>Choose how the external program should appear, this can be either in a normal window, maximised window, minimised window or hidden.</P>
<P><B>No Window:</B><BR>Set this option to stop the program from creating a window when run.</P>
<P><B>Start using ShellExecute:</B><BR>This option determines if the program should be launched by the "ShellExecute" command. ShellExecute lets you specify non-executable file types, like .txt or .html, or even shell recognised commands like web addresses or "mailto:" commands. These types of commands are then executed using the program that is associated to them.  For example, specifying a .html file as the program will launch your default web browser and load that file.</P>
<P><B>Wait for exit:</B><BR>This will make MediaPortal wait until the program has finished before moving on.</P>
<P><B>Force window focus:</B><BR>This will attempt to force the application's main window into focus.  Try enabling this option if you find you application is launched but without focus.</P>
