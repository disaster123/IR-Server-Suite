-host [Host Address]<BR>
<BR>
Insert a half second delay between virtual remote buttons:<BR>
~<BR>
<BR>
Everything else is considered a virtual remote button.</P>

<P>To send the keycode 1123 use the following command line parameters:<BR>
VirtualRemote.exe 1123</P>

<P>To send multiple simulated buttons to a specific IR Server use the following command line parameters:<BR>
VirtualRemote.exe -host MediaServer 11223 1123223 aa2x3433d</P>

<P>To send multiple simulated buttons with half second delays between them:<BR>
VirtualRemote.exe key1112 ~ button443 ~ AA-FF-11-12</P>

<P>To send simulated buttons with spaces in their codes use quotation marks:<BR>
VirtualRemote.exe "Button 1" "Button 2"</P>
