<P>The biggest problem with PC remote control applications is the configuration process.  They generally fall into one of two categories.  The first category is the “easy to setup but inflexible” category, and the second is the “difficult to setup but highly flexible” category.</P>

<P><B>Case in point: ByRemote HIP vs Promixis Girder.</B></P>

<P>HIP is easy to setup without any prior knowledge, but HIP is not as feature rich or flexible as Girder.  Don't get me wrong here, it's a fantastic program which I highly recommend, but it's not <I>as</I> feature rich as Girder.</P>

<P>Girder on the other hand is very difficult to setup <I>compared to HIP</I>, it has a steep learning curve, but is feature rich and flexible.</P>

<P>This document does not seek to make a value judgement on either application.  Both have their advantages and disadvantages.</P>

<P>One of the goals in software development is to produce software that "just works".  Software that is easy to use but also powerful enough to be adapted different situations.</P>

<P>For PC Remote Control software one solution to the traditional trade-off between usability and flexibility is the subject of this document, the Abstract Remote Model.</P>

<P>By agreeing on the most common remote buttons and including a collection of mappings to make all the supported remotes fit the common model we can provide a default configuration that will work on all supported remotes with no setup required.  Default configurations would be supplied for a large number of common PC applications, as well as general OS navigation and use.</P>

<P>The drawback with other simplified systems of this nature is that you lose the flexibility to define different buttons and functions outside the simplified model, but with the Abstract Remote Model proposed any remote button that is not mapped onto the abstract model will be passed on in it’s raw form, thereby enabling the user to customize beyond the default configuration.</P>

<P>What follows is the Abstract Remote Model button list as of Version 0.1 of the Abstract Remote Model.</P>
