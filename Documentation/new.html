<P>Version 1.4.2
<UL>
<LI>MP Control plugin: Fixed Macro command for Multi-Mapping.</LI>
<LI>MCE Remote Receiver: Fixed XP and Replacement driver blasting bug that has existed since October.</LI>
<LI>AdsTech 335 Receiver: Attempted to fix a bug that caused Input Service to crash roughly every 5 minutes.</LI>
<LI>Installer: New IR Server Suite installer.  It looks more professional and you can now change the MediaPortal plugin install paths.</LI>
<LI>General: Fixed the "pause" macro command.</LI>
<LI>MCE Remote Receiver: Fixed another XP and Vista suspend/resume bug.  When will it all end? ;)</LI>
<LI>Input plugins: Modified some method signatures.</LI>
<LI>TV3 Blaster Plugin: Fixed a fatal error.</LI>
<LI>General: Anywhere that previously took user input for a command and could include escape codes can now also include Environment Variables (including clipboard contents, date, time, and others).  See documentation for more info.</LI>
<LI>IR Blast: Now defaults to "localhost" if no host is specified on the command line (this will make it simpler to use on most setups).</LI>
<LI>IR Blast: Now has a default delay between blasts of 50 milliseconds, this can be customized by the command line parameter "-delay x", where x is a delay in milliseconds (0 for no delay).</LI>
<LI>MP Control plugin: Multi-Mapping command can now jump to a specific mapping set (or "Toggle").</LI>
<LI>MediaPortal plugins: New macro commands (Send MP Action and Send MP Message).</LI>
<LI>Translator: Can create a shortcut on the users desktop to launch a macro.</LI>
<LI>Documentation: New documentation areas (Troubleshooting FAQ) and improvements.</LI>
<LI>MCE Remote Receiver: Can now set remote and keyboard repeat rates to mimic system keyboard repeat rate settings.</LI>
<LI>New Input Plugin: Added support for HCW (Hauppauge) Receiver - Experimental.</LI>
<LI>Translator: Added a "remap" button for changing the button associated with a command.</LI>
<LI>IR Server Plugin: Added support for RC102 and compatible receivers - Experimental.</LI>
<LI>TCP Comms: Automatically maps "localhost" to loopback address, avoiding the lookup process.  This <i>might</i> solve a host name lookup problem for some users.</LI>
<LI>USB-UIRT: Fixed a bug that caused the receive callback to get garbage collected, crashing the Input Service.</LI>
<LI>FusionREMOTE: Can now tell the difference between different DViCo remotes (You will need to re-teach the button keycodes).</LI>
<LI>General: Receiving device name is now sent along with remote button codes, this is in preparation for a major overhaul of the remote mapping system to facilitate automatic configuration for controlling your whole PC!  This feature will not be completed until 1.0.4.3 or 1.0.5.0 but it will be very big if it comes together as planned.</LI>
<LI>New Prorgam: Added Keyboard Input Relay, to enable mapping special (App Command) keyboard buttons (like Forward, Back, Play, Stop, Volume, etc...) as well as basic key combinations as if they are remote button presses.</LI>
<LI>New Input Plugin: Direct Input.  This allows the user to map game controllers (gamepads, joysticks, etc...) as remotes.  First version is basic, next version will allow button combos and controlling the mouse with analog sticks.</LI>
<LI>General: Implemented first draft of Abstract Remote Model.  This will be expanded on in Version 1.4.3 to provide a superior automatic configuration method for all Applications and Plugins.</LI>
<LI>MCE Transceiver: No longer sends those remote buttons that are being automatically handled, if automatic handling is disabled it will send the full set.  This will prevent double presses from occurring.  Note that this only effects the buttons that are automatically handled, the other buttons will continue to be sent regardless.</LI>
<LI>New Input Plugin: Added Experimental Mac Mini receiver support.</LI>
<LI>New Input Plugin: Added Experimental Leadtek CoolCommand receiver support.</LI>

<P>Version 1.0.4.1
<UL>
<LI>Minor bug fixes.</LI>
<LI>Made MCE Remote XP/Replacement driver support more forgiving of malformed/unusual data from device.</LI>
<LI>Raised thread priorities from Below Normal to Normal (Hopefully to improve responsiveness, if there are any ill side effects I'll revert this change) and made all threads "Background" (to prevent them from living on after the thread spawner has closed).</LI>
<LI>Made error logging more uniform (makes code comparisons between similar libraries easier too, this should make it less likely that a change in, for example, TV2 Blaster plugin would not get made in TV3 Blaster plugin).</LI>
<LI>Moved Input Server Plugins from "\IR Server Suite\IR Server" to "\IR Server Suite\Input Service" to bring them in-line with the move from IR Server to Input Service.  Existing users will need to move their configuration files (*.xml) across or reconfigure their transceiver.</LI>
<LI>Changed timestamps in log files to same format as MediaPortal's in preperation for new log file analysing tool I'm writing.</LI>
<LI>Added support for the Ads Tech PTV-335's IR Receiver.  You must copy the ADS_335_RCPLIB.dll from (usually) "\Program Files\Ulead Systems\Ulead InstaMedia 2.1" to the IR Server Plugins folder in your IR Server Suite install location.</LI>
<LI>Fixed Vista MCE Suspend/Resume handling.</LI>
</UL></P>

</UL></P>
<BR>

<P>Version 1.0.3.5
<UL>
<LI>Fixed a bug in the macro and IR command renaming.</LI>

<LI>Fixed repeating IR decoding in JVC, RC5, RC6 and NEC protocols on MCE device.</LI>
<LI>Fixed Sony SIRC IR decoding on MCE device, now works for 8, 12, 15 and 20 bit protocol variations (instead of just 15-bit).</LI>
<LI>Added Daewoo, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Nokia NRC17, Panasonic, and Toshiba protocol decoding on MCE device.</LI>
<LI>Made IR and Macro file renaming more intelligent.</LI>
<LI>Made more macro commands available in Translator and the Plugins (Mouse commands, CD Eject, TCP Messages).</LI>

<LI>Added a Translator OSD that can task swap, run macros and some other useful things.</LI>
<LI>Added some new macro commands (HTTP requests, beep sound, wave file playback).</LI>
<LI>Commands (including macros) now execute on separate threads.  In the past calling a macro for example would block the caller until it finished, now the caller can continue while the macro executes independantly.  Note that this will cause a subtle change in flow control, but shouldn't effect anyone.</LI>
<LI>Added support for Girder 3.x plugins, still experimental at this stage. Expect to see improvements in this area, like multiple Girder plugins active at the same time.</LI>
<LI>Virtual Remote now has a companion application called Web Remote, with a built in web server for simulating a remote control over the web.</LI>
<LI>Added support for the RedEye blaster device.</LI>
<LI>Added support for the Nintendo Wii Remote (no classic controller or accelerometer support yet).</LI>
<LI>Improved suspend/resume handling ... again ... hopefully this works!</LI>

<LI>Jens has helped me get 64-bit MCE remote support working properly, finally! :)</LI>
<LI>Added a swag of new STB presets.</LI>
<LI>Added RC6 Foxtel variation support for MCE Remote protocol decoding.</LI>
<LI>Simplified Macro file format.  Old macro's must be converted or rebuilt.  This change will speed up the introduction of new features.</LI>
</UL></P>
<BR>

<P>Version 1.0.3.4
<UL>
<LI>No longer uses Named Pipes IPC, now uses TCP for communications between server and clients.  This should solve a lot of problems.</LI>

<LI>Attempted to fix Tray Launcher focus issue.</LI>
<LI>Added several new Set Top Box Quick-Setup options.</LI>
<LI>Added Automatic Detection of IR Devices.</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug in setting up Windows Message commands in Translator.</LI>
<LI>Added the ability to nest macros.  Looping macros will fail at runtime producing an error log entry, so you should always test your macros.</LI>
<LI>Can now rename IR Commands and Macros by clicking on them in their lists.  Just like renaming a file in Windows Explorer.</LI>
