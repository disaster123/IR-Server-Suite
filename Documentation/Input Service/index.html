Choose the device(s) you want to use for receiving and the device you want to use for transmitting (blasting) by placing a mark in the box under the appropriate column.  By double-clicking the device name in the device plugin list you can select both receiving and transmitting cabilities for that device at the same time.  Note that you do not need to have a device selected in either column, that is, you can run the Input Service without a transmit, receive or either type of device enabled.<BR>
